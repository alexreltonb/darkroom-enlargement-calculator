# darkroom-enlargement-calculator
An HTML-based tool that calculates new darkroom exposure times based on changes in print enlargement dimensions.

This simple tool helps film photographers calculate the correct exposure time when changing print sizes in the darkroom. By entering the original exposure time and both the old and new print dimensions, the calculator adjusts for changes in magnification using the square law of enlargement. Ideal for dialing in a test print on smaller paper and scaling up to your final print size without wasting materials.
